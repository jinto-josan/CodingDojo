CodingDojo 🥋
A personal dojo for mastering the art of code.

This monorepo is a living journal of my journey through programming — from fundamentals to frameworks, from toy projects to real-world builds. Each folder is a lesson, each commit a step forward.

Like a dojo, this is a place of discipline, practice, and constant refinement.
